# Vilify

Bespoke vim-style command palettes for the web. Each site gets its own carefully crafted keyboard-driven experience.

## Sites

- **YouTube** - `vilify-youtube.user.js`

## Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Click on a userscript file and select "Install"

## Usage

Press `Space` to open the command palette, then use vim-style motions:

- `G H` - Go Home
- `G S` - Go to Subscriptions
- `Y Y` - Yank (copy) video URL
- `Y T` - Yank video title
- `J` / `L` - Seek back/forward
- `F` - Fullscreen
- ...and more

## Philosophy

Unlike generic browser extensions that try to handle all websites poorly, Vilify provides deep, site-specific integrations. Each palette is themed to match the site and offers commands that make sense for that context.

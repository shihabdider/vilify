# Keyring

Bespoke command palettes for the web. Each site gets its own carefully crafted Cmd+K experience.

## Sites

- **YouTube** - `keyring-youtube.user.js`

## Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Click on a userscript file and select "Install"

## Usage

Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette.

## Philosophy

Unlike generic browser extensions that try to handle all websites poorly, Keyring provides deep, site-specific integrations. Each palette is themed to match the site and offers commands that make sense for that context.
